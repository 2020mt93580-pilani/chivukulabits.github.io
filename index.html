    Cisco’s Supply Chain organization has recently been given the responsibility to support the full Offer Lifecycle process from Ideation through to End of Life 
    for all Monetization Models at Cisco. An offer is a grouping of product (HW, SW, and Service options) that provide a better value proposition to our customers by 
    addressing a specific outcome. Cisco has standardized our approach. Systems, processes, and data that enable this end-to-end process are crucial for bringing products 
    to market in a timely manner, with high quality, and with the customer and partner’s needs in mind. 
    The project requires an end to end development of a new UI with Angular 5 version in front end and JAVA web application in backend. 
    This new application will be a customer facing application for Cisco.
